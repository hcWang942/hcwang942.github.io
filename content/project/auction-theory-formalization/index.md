## Project Overview

This final year project, supervised by [Dr. Ma Jiajun](https://www.majiajun.org/) at Xiamen University's Department of Mathematics, focuses on the formalization of auction theory concepts using the Lean 4 theorem prover and Mathlib4 library.

## Key Achievements

### Formalized Theorems
- **Second-price Auction DSIC (Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible)**
- **Myerson's Lemma** - A fundamental result in mechanism design
- **Nash Equilibrium properties** in game-theoretic contexts
- **Minimax Theorem** formalization (in progress)
- **Brouwer Fixed-point Theorem** applications

### Contributions to Open Source
- **Mathlib4 Pull Request [#13248](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13248)**: Contributing formalized proofs to the world's largest mathematical library
- **GameTheory Repository**: Active contributor to the [game theory formalization project](https://github.com/math-xmum/gametheory)

## Technical Details

### Tools and Technologies
- **Lean 4**: Modern theorem prover with dependent type theory
- **Mathlib4**: Comprehensive mathematical library
- **Game Theory Framework**: Building foundational structures for mechanism design

### Mathematical Concepts Formalized
- **Auction Mechanisms**: First-price and second-price auctions
- **Incentive Compatibility**: Formal verification of strategy-proofness
- **Revenue Equivalence**: Theoretical foundations of auction design
- **Mechanism Design**: General frameworks for economic mechanisms

## Impact and Recognition

This work represents one of the first comprehensive formalizations of auction theory in Lean 4, contributing to:

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: Providing machine-verified proofs of fundamental auction theory results
2. **Educational Value**: Creating accessible formalized mathematics for teaching game theory
3. **Research Foundation**: Establishing groundwork for further formalization of economic theory
4. **Open Science**: Contributing to the global mathematical knowledge base through Mathlib4

## Future Directions

Building on this foundation, future work includes:
- Extending to more complex auction formats (combinatorial auctions, multi-unit auctions)
- Formalizing advanced topics in mechanism design
- Integration with computational economics and algorithmic game theory
- Applications to blockchain and cryptocurrency auction mechanisms
