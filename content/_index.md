        My research focuses on enhancing large language models' capabilities in formal mathematical reasoning and automated theorem proving. I'm particularly interested in:

        - **Formal Theorem Proving**: Developing techniques to formalize mathematical theorems and proofs using tools like Lean 4
        - **LLMs for Mathematical Reasoning**: Training and fine-tuning large language models to improve mathematical reasoning capabilities
        - **Agent Building**: Creating intelligent agents that can autonomously tackle complex mathematical problems
        - **Reinforcement Learning**: Applying RL techniques to improve LLM performance on theorem proving tasks

        I apply a range of quantitative methods and deep learning approaches to build systems that can advance the state of artificial mathematical reasoning.
        
        Please reach out if you're interested in collaborating! ðŸ“§

        ### DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 & V2
        Developed a novel hybrid approach combining LLMs and Monte-Carlo tree search for automated theorem proving. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the miniF2F (63.5%) and ProofNet (25.3%) benchmarks.

        ### LeanBENCH
        Currently developing a comprehensive benchmark for autoformalization of college-level and olympiad-level mathematics in Lean4. This ongoing project aims to create a dataset of 12k formalized mathematical problems.

        ### Formalization of Auction Theory
        Working on formalizing auction theory in game theory using Lean4, including second price auction DSIC and Myerson's lemma. Contributing to the GameTheory repository and Mathlib4.
